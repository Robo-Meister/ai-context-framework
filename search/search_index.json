The overall idea is to treat every SVG asset as contextual knowledge, expose that knowledge inside prompts, and let the language model describe how to reuse and compose the pieces when new imagery is required. Asset Library Requirements \u00b6 To keep the generated artwork editable after the fact, organise the SVG library with the following conventions: Semantic Grouping \u2013 Store related shapes inside <g> elements whose id attributes are human-readable (e.g. hero_character/body ), so that the model can refer to them by name. Layer Metadata \u2013 Add JSON or YAML sidecar files that describe the visual purpose of each group (\"foreground character\", \"background gradient\", etc.). This metadata can be ingested alongside the raw SVG markup when building the context packet. Reusable Palette Tokens \u2013 Encode colours and gradients as CSS variables or named <defs> entries so that the model can remix palettes without editing literal hex codes. Fine-Grained Bounding Boxes \u2013 When possible, pre-compute simple bounding box coordinates for key elements and store them inside the metadata so that downstream tooling can reposition layers with minimal geometry work. Context Map Structure \u00b6 When you prepare a generation run, attach the SVG metadata to the context map under a dedicated channel (e.g. visual_assets ). Each entry should contain: A concise natural-language summary of the asset and its intended use. The path to the SVG file (or an inlined subset of its markup if the file is small). Optional references to palette tokens, font choices, and reusable backgrounds. During prompt construction, point the model to the relevant entries by name, and explain how the asset descriptions map to layers inside the final composition. Prompting Pattern \u00b6 In the task prompt, request the model to output a JSON (or another structured) plan that lists the layers to compose. For example: { \"canvas\": { \"width\": 1920, \"height\": 1080 }, \"layers\": [ { \"source\": \"characters/hero.svg#pose-1\", \"transform\": \"scale(1.1) translate(40, -20)\" }, { \"source\": \"backgrounds/cityscape.svg#layer-base\", \"opacity\": 0.85 }, { \"source\": \"effects/sun_glow.svg\", \"blend\": \"screen\" } ] } Because the model is operating on textual context, it will not rasterise the final artwork; instead, it will suggest which pre-existing SVG fragments to compose, along with any transformations. A thin automation layer can then apply these instructions with a deterministic SVG manipulation library (such as cairosvg , svgpathtools , or browser-side DOM APIs). Benefits \u00b6 Editability \u2013 Each layer remains an SVG group, so designers can tweak the shapes in vector tools without recreating the entire illustration. Consistency \u2013 Palettes, iconography, and proportions stay aligned with existing branding guidelines because all assets originate from a controlled library. Traceability \u2013 The prompt output doubles as a build manifest, making it easy to track which assets were combined and how they were transformed. Limitations and Mitigations \u00b6 Library Coverage \u2013 The approach only works if the asset library already contains suitable components. Fill gaps by commissioning new base assets or by adding a \"fallback\" layer type that can be generated on the fly. Prompt Budget \u2013 Large SVG files can exhaust context length. Use summaries and only expose the relevant fragments when constructing the context map. Geometric Precision \u2013 Free-form text instructions may need validation. Couple the generation step with lightweight rules or a post-processing script that verifies bounds and naming before committing the composed SVG. With these pieces in place, the framework can extend the same context-driven workflow it uses for text to orchestrate layered, editable SVG artwork. Example Asset Library \u00b6 For a concrete illustration of these conventions, see the sample library under docs/examples/svg_library . It contains characters, backgrounds, and effects SVGs grouped semantically, paired with JSON or YAML metadata that encodes summaries, palette tokens, and bounding boxes. The accompanying README shows how to translate the metadata into a context packet and a model-generated layer plan. Reference Pipeline \u00b6 The repository ships with a SvgLayerPipeline that automates the steps above. It gathers SVG metadata from any context provider, packages it into the visual_assets channel, asks an inference engine for a JSON plan, and post-processes the response so only resolvable layers remain. Bounding boxes defined in the metadata are merged into the final plan so downstream tooling can position fragments deterministically. See src/caiengine/pipelines/svg_layer_pipeline.py for the implementation and tests/test_svg_layer_pipeline.py for usage examples. Converting plans into layer actions \u00b6 Once a plan has been validated you can feed it into SvgActionPlanner to obtain an ordered list of explicit actions. Each entry is tagged as an add , transform , remove , or update command and includes the resolved asset fragment, bounding boxes, inline SVG payloads, and any requested transforms. This keeps the orchestration service focused on high-level intent while your SVG manipulation layer performs precise DOM edits or compositing work.\u3010F:src/caiengine/pipelines/svg_layer_actions.py\u2020L1-L247\u3011\u3010F:tests/test_svg_layer_actions.py\u2020L1-L123\u3011","title":"SVG Layered Generation"},{"location":"svg_layered_generation.html#layered-svg-generation-via-context-aware-prompting","text":"This note explains how to extend the AI Context Framework so that text-generation sessions can also request layered SVG artwork that is easy to post-process.

The goal-driven feedback loop can run as a lightweight background task to nudge progress quietly. Background Worker \u00b6 Run the loop inside a background worker, service worker, or scheduled task. The worker should periodically poll for new actions or subscribe to an event stream. Use the scaffold in GoalFeedbackWorker as a starting point. In production, back the accompanying GoalStateTracker with a durable backend such as SQLiteGoalStateBackend or RedisGoalStateBackend so restarts do not drop pending actions. The worker already emits structured log warnings when it falls back to the in-process poller or when the loop enters exponential backoff; wire those into your observability pipeline to surface stalled feedback processing quickly. State Tracking \u00b6 Persist the current goal state and any progress metrics in storage accessible by the worker (memory, local database, etc.). Update this state whenever goals change so the loop can compare new actions against the latest target. GoalDrivenFeedbackLoop now supports pluggable persistence providers. Pass a custom provider that implements GoalFeedbackPersistence when constructing the loop to persist the action history and calculated baselines into durable storage (e.g. SQLite, Redis, or a managed cache).

Both policies can be combined. After pruning, baselines automatically recalculate so that analytics continue to reflect the oldest retained datapoints. Event-Driven Updates \u00b6 When a new action appears, send it to the worker through a queue or message channel. The worker computes suggestions only when history or goal state changes, limiting needless work. FeedbackEventBus offers a minimal publish/subscribe interface.

When configuring formatters include the field names you care about, e.g. %(message)s pending=%(pending_actions)s , or use a JSON formatter to retain the structured attributes automatically. Goal Feedback Loop Diagnostics \u00b6 GoalFeedbackWorker escalates retries into exponential backoff while tagging every failure with attempt and backoff_seconds . A follow-up debug log then emits backoff_remaining while the worker sleeps. Configure your logging pipeline to alert when those fields remain high for several cycles\u2014this usually means the underlying provider keeps raising and the loop is stuck. GoalStateTracker and the storage backends also log when they fall back to in-memory persistence. Treat that warning as an operational smell in environments where resilience matters and override the backend with SQLite or Redis in production deployments. Provider Error Visibility \u00b6 Each context provider now emits structured errors if a subscriber callback crashes or if ingestion fails. The records include the subscriber_id , context_id , and backend-specific identifiers (for example, the SQLite database path). Attach handlers with filters that forward these errors to the same observability system as the rest of your application so that failed downstream consumers are visible without reproducing the issue locally. Token Usage Telemetry \u00b6 Inference engines wrapped by TokenUsageTracker now emit structured telemetry for every model invocation. Pipelines created through ConfigurablePipeline.from_dict automatically forward these events to the AuditLogger so downstream systems can observe prompt/completion token consumption per provider/category combination. Each audit record uses the token_usage step name and provides a payload similar to: { \"timestamp\": \"2024-05-12T10:15:32.123456\", \"operation\": \"predict\", \"provider\": \"memory\", \"category\": \"support\", \"usage\": { \"prompt_tokens\": 42, \"completion_tokens\": 13, \"total_tokens\": 55 } } Attach custom listeners to TokenUsageTracker.register_usage_listener if you need to ship the telemetry to additional observability sinks. Hooking into External Observability \u00b6 If you need to forward logs to an external sink, attach handlers to the relevant logger: handler = logging.StreamHandler() handler.setLevel(\"WARNING\") logging.getLogger(\"caiengine.providers.kafka_context_provider.KafkaContextProvider\").addHandler(handler) Handlers inherit levels from their parent logger hierarchy. Set propagate = False if you want to suppress duplicate entries once a custom handler is attached. Service Middleware Hooks \u00b6 CAIService now exposes its HTTP surface through FastAPI which makes it easy to insert cross-cutting concerns via middleware. Three lightweight middlewares are enabled out of the box and can be tuned when the service is constructed: Concern Configuration knob Notes Authentication auth_hook: Callable[[Request], Awaitable[AuthDecision] | AuthDecision] Hook receives the incoming Request and may return a Response , a dict payload, or False to reject the call. Error handling error_handler: Callable[[Exception, Request], Awaitable[Response | dict] | Response | dict] , include_error_details: bool Translate exceptions into custom JSON payloads or expose the original error message when include_error_details is set.

Registry Integration"},{"location":"dev/ocr_to_structured_data.html","text":"Integrating OCR Pipelines with CAIEngine \u00b6 This guide describes how to connect an existing OCR service that already produces plain text, document type predictions, and preliminary key/value candidates with CAIEngine so you can replace brittle regular-expression post-processing with the framework's context routing and inference hooks. 1. High-Level Flow \u00b6 Run OCR outside of CAIEngine. Use your OCR system to obtain (a) the raw text of each document and (b) any metadata it provides such as page segmentation, document type guesses, or candidate key/value pairs. Wrap OCR output in a ContextProvider . Create a provider class that yields ContextItem objects representing each document or logical section. Attach the OCR metadata to the context payload so downstream modules can use it for scoring and extraction. Apply CAIEngine's deduplication and categorization stages. Use the built-in Deduplicator and Categorizer modules to cluster content snippets and filter noise. You can feed your OCR type guess into the categorizer as an initial signal, while allowing the engine's embedding similarity and rules to refine the classification. Fuse signals into a clean record. Configure the Fuser to consolidate overlapping snippets (e.g., repeated headers) and to merge OCR metadata with context-based insights. Invoke an AIInferenceEngine . Implement an inference hook that maps the fused context into your structured schema (r\u00e9sum\u00e9, invoice, contract, etc.). This component can use LLM prompts, ML classifiers, or deterministic logic tailored to your domain. Export to your target format. After inference, serialize the structured data into the format your downstream systems expect (JSON, CSV, database rows, etc.). 2. Implementing the OCR Context Provider \u00b6 Create a provider class under src/caiengine/providers (or your preferred module) that reads OCR output (files, API responses, or database rows) and yields ContextItem instances. Include fields such as: raw_text : the OCR-extracted text. document_type_hint : the OCR service's predicted type (e.g., invoice, CV). spans : offsets or bounding boxes for each candidate field the OCR detected. confidence_scores : numeric confidence metrics from the OCR service. By keeping these signals inside the context, CAIEngine modules can incorporate confidence and structural hints rather than relying on regexes. 2.1 Use the Built-in OCRContextProvider \u00b6 The repository now ships with an OCRContextProvider that implements the pattern above. It accepts raw OCR text, optional display_text , confidence scores, and either OCRSpan objects or dictionaries describing bounding boxes. Each ingested document is stored in a ContextData record with the ocr_metadata field populated so downstream modules can access both the structured payload and the spatial metadata. If you already have OCR spans represented as dictionaries, pass them directly to ingest_ocr_document ; they will be normalised into strongly-typed OCRSpan instances. This simplifies integrating new OCR sources without rewriting your data mapping logic. 3. Smarter Categorization than Regex \u00b6 Instead of regular expressions, leverage the TextEmbeddingComparer plus your OCR metadata: Seed the categorizer with representative exemplars for each document type. Combine embedding similarity with the OCR-provided document_type_hint to boost accuracy (e.g., accept the OCR label only if similarity exceeds a threshold; otherwise fall back to the most similar exemplar). Store hard rules only for high-precision cues (e.g., specific tax identifiers) rather than broad regex heuristics. This hybrid approach reduces false positives and allows the categorizer to adapt as you feed more training data. 3.1 Extending the Categorizer for OCR Signals \u00b6 For tricky OCR documents\u2014such as those with mixed languages, tables embedded as images, or heavily rotated scans\u2014augment the categorizer with richer signals so it can disambiguate near-duplicate content: Create OCR-aware features. In your ContextItem payload, add fields that capture layout hints (page numbers, column indexes), language detection results, and OCR confidence scores. These features give the categorizer more than just text similarity when deciding among competing categories. Add metadata-based scorers. Implement a custom SimilarityScorer that rewards matches where the OCR metadata aligns with category expectations (e.g., invoices usually contain currency symbols; resumes reference job titles). Register this scorer alongside the default embedding comparer. Handle weak OCR predictions. When the OCR engine emits low-confidence labels, fall back to embedding similarity plus rule-based overrides. This prevents a noisy OCR guess from locking the item into the wrong category. Log ambiguous assignments. Track cases where the categorizer returns multiple candidates with close scores. Review these examples, tune your OCR pipeline (deskewing, contrast boosting), and add new exemplars to narrow the margin over time. By enriching the categorizer with OCR-specific metadata and feedback, you can support documents that would otherwise be misrouted by pure text similarity or regex heuristics. 3.2 Returning Structured OCR Fields with Spatial Context \u00b6 Meeting downstream OCR consumers\u2014such as invoice ingestion systems that expect values plus their on-page position\u2014typically requires augmenting the categorizer with a richer payload than just raw text. A practical recipe is: Preserve whitespace-aligned text. Instead of normalising all whitespace, keep the OCR provider's spacing so you can reconstruct columnar layouts (tables, totals blocks). Store both the raw text and a \"display\" version that pads each line with spaces to mirror the original grid. Your ContextItem.payload might expose {\"text\": raw_text, \"display_text\": formatted_text} . Attach geometric spans per candidate field. Include bounding boxes or character-offset ranges for key OCR detections (invoice number, line items, totals). For example, add {\"field\": \"invoice_number\", \"bbox\": [x1, y1, x2, y2]} entries. When the categorizer selects a document type, downstream inference can recover both the value and its location. Score against layout-aware prototypes. Seed each category with exemplar snippets that include structured hints (e.g., a JSON blob of expected fields and their spatial relationships). Implement a custom SimilarityScorer that rewards OCR items whose detected fields align with the exemplar schema\u2014helping distinguish invoices with line-item tables from quotes or purchase orders. Emit structured context for inference. After categorization, package the enriched OCR payload into the fused context so your AIInferenceEngine can format the final record. For invoices, the inference step can iterate over the line_items span list, reconstruct each row's text via the preserved spacing, and output an ordered table alongside header fields such as invoice number and totals. These additions let the categorizer maintain spatial fidelity while still benefiting from embedding similarity and metadata signals. 4. Structured Extraction via Inference Engines \u00b6 Inside your AIInferenceEngine implementation: Receive the fused context items plus OCR metadata. Prompt an LLM or run a classifier to extract fields such as totals, vendor names, employment dates, or contract clauses. Use the OCR spans /coordinates to map extracted values back to the original document for auditing or highlighting. Validate required fields (e.g., totals > 0, presence of currency) before finalizing the record. Because the inference layer works on cleaned, categorized context, it can focus on semantic extraction rather than compensating for noisy regex groupings. 5. Output Formatting and Feedback Loops \u00b6 After extraction, push the structured record to your downstream format. Capture feedback from users (corrections, approvals) and feed it into CAIEngine's goal feedback loop so the categorizer and inference prompts improve over time. By isolating OCR as a pre-processing step and letting CAIEngine handle context management, categorization, and inference, you can replace fragile regex logic with a modular pipeline that is easier to extend and maintain.","title":"Integrating OCR Pipelines with CAIEngine"},{"location":"dev/ocr_to_structured_data.html#integrating-ocr-pipelines-with-caiengine","text":"This guide describes how to connect an existing OCR service that already produces plain text, document type predictions, and preliminary key/value candidates with CAIEngine so you can replace brittle regular-expression post-processing with the framework's context routing and inference hooks.","title":"Integrating OCR Pipelines with CAIEngine"},{"location":"dev/ocr_to_structured_data.html#1-high-level-flow","text":"Run OCR outside of CAIEngine.

See the module docstrings in caiengine.providers for the full argument lists.
