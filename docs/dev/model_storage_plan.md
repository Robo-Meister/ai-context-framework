# Model Storage & Registry Plan

This document outlines the approach for Phase 6 of the project, delivering
portable and context‑aware model bundles.

## 1. Standard Representation

- **ONNX as the core model format** for interoperability across runtimes.
- A companion `manifest.yaml` or `manifest.toml` captures metadata such as
  model name, version, training context, required preprocessing and
  postprocessing steps, dependencies, and license details.

## 2. Packaging

- Package `model.onnx` and the manifest in a single archive (ZIP or OCI
  artifact).
- Optionally use content‑addressed or hashed file names to support
  reproducibility.

## 3. Tooling

- Provide utilities to load, validate, and migrate bundles across
  environments.
- Include simple CLI helpers for exporting, importing, and verifying model
  compatibility with the manifest.

## 4. Registry Integration

- Adopt a predictable bundle layout so a future registry can index manifest
  fields for discovery.
- Support context‑aware search and retrieval based on metadata such as
  task, framework version, and required hardware.

This plan establishes a portable "ONNX + manifest" standard, enabling
consistent model management, transport, and discovery across the project.
