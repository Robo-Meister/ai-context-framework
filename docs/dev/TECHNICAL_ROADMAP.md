🔬 Priority 4: Provider Abstractions & Expansion

# 9. KafkaContextProvider (Pub/Sub Support)
✅ Read from Kafka topic, deserialize, store internally or forward to context engine
✅ Publish ingested context and feedback via Kafka
🔧 Why: Prepares ground for high-velocity, scalable deployments.
🚧 Priority 5: Preparation for Extensibility & Learning

# 13. Data Standardizer for Robo Connector Workflows
⛔️ Original integration likely dropped
⏳ Provide JSON-based normalization of Robo Connector logs
🔧 Why: Maintains compatibility with legacy flows without full integration
# 16. Packaging Improvements & PyPI Publishing
⏳ Finalize module layout and import paths (see **Phase 2** in [Roadmap](../../Roadmap.md))
✅ Provide `extras_require` for optional dependencies
⏳ Build and upload distribution artifacts to PyPI
🔧 Why: Makes installation and distribution straightforward for users.
# 17. CI/CD Pipeline Integration
⏳ Add GitHub Actions workflow for linting, tests and packaging
⏳ Automate PyPI deployment on version tags (Phase 2 milestone)
🔧 Why: Ensures consistent releases and quick feedback on pull requests.
# 18. Documentation Site & Community Tooling
⏳ Publish a docs site with mkdocs or docsify (refer to **Phase 5** in [Roadmap](../../Roadmap.md))
⏳ Showcase examples and plugin discovery helpers
⏳ Add issue and PR templates to grow community engagement
🔧 Why: Phase 5 focuses on user adoption and community growth.

## Completed

# 🥇 Priority 1: Core Debugging Infrastructure

1. Context Inspector API
✅ Basic API: list, fetch, filter by time, source, roles
✅ Raw + filtered (Kalman-ready) context view
✅ Support Redis first (extendable to others)
🔧 Why: Base for UI, CLI tools, test harnesses, confidence checking.
🥈 Priority 2: Vector/Embedding Analysis

# 2. Vector Comparison API + Diff Tools
✅ Pairwise comparison (cosine, distance, trust-aware)
✅ VectorCalculator & Filter fused API
✅ Dump vectors to file or visualize drift
🔧 Why: Helps track semantic matching, AI misfires, similarity thresholds.
# 3. Kalman Filter Integration
✅ Add Kalman filter as optional layer in vector calculator
✅ Flag in provider whether to use it
✅ Dump raw vs filtered output for debug
🔧 Why: Adds signal smoothing, suppresses noise in evolving context streams.
# 4. Vector Normalization Implementation
✅ Normalize embeddings to unit vectors
✅ Enforce consistent magnitude across providers
🔧 Why: Ensures stable similarity calculations.
🥉 Priority 3: Trust + Flow Debugging

# 5. Trust Calculation Trace
✅ Output intermediate trust values
✅ Identify influence of actor history, vector similarity, and metadata
✅ Enable override for testing
🔧 Why: Trust drift or anomalies are hard to diagnose without this.
# 6. Context Trigger Flow Tracing
✅ Record “context → matched rule → trigger fired”
✅ Capture matching similarity score
✅ (Later) Tie to Robo Connector flow matching engine
🔧 Why: Explains why something happened — a major ask in audits or validation.
# 7. Standardized Context Provider Interface
✅ Formal interface (BaseContextProvider)
✅ Existing RedisContextProvider refactored to implement it
✅ Hooks for filtering and post-processing
🔧 Why: Enables plug-in logic for Redis/Kafka/Static/Memory/etc.
# 8. Cache/MemoryContextProvider (In-Memory Only)
✅ No Redis/Kafka dependency
✅ Use for dev, testing, and minimal setups
✅ Support filtering and similarity search
🔧 Why: Reduces friction for newcomers and local testing.
# 10. Role Schema JSON Definition
✅ Describe standard role fields and metadata
✅ Publish example schema file
🔧 Why: Provides consistent role handling across providers and tools.
# 11. Time-Decay & ANN Search Support
✅ Apply time-decay weighting for older context
✅ Integrate approximate nearest neighbor indexes
🔧 Why: Improves relevance and speeds up context lookups.
# 12. Model Interface for Inference & Feedback
✅ Abstract NN behind interface (e.g. ContextEncoderInterface)
✅ Swap in local model, OpenAI, or any provider
✅ (Later) Feedback hook: “was this match correct?”
🔧 Why: Critical to enable learning, personalization, or modular deployments.
# 🔌 14. Context Relay / ContextBus (Internal Mesh)
✅ Accept context from multiple sources (Redis, Kafka, Memory, etc.)
✅ Relay/mirror context to other nodes (via HTTP, gRPC, or message broker)
✅ Optional: context filtering before relaying
📎 Use cases: multi-node AI, real-time cooperation, mesh architecture
🔧 Why: Enables distributed agents or Robo Assistants to share situational data in real-time.
📌 Suggestion: Add to Priority 3 or 4, as it's foundational for scaling and very reusable.

# 🧠 15. Network-Aware Context Hooks
✅ Define external hooks/triggers based on context change
✅ Push matched context (or diff) to other services
✅ Allow action broadcasting / event chaining
🔧 Why: Turns your system into a live graph of interconnected services — critical for Robo Assistant, swarm logic, and long-term Neuraflow.
📌 Suggestion: Add to Priority 5, after filter + trigger tracing.

# 19. CLI for Manual Ingestion & Querying (Roadmap Phase 3 - Plugin & Provider Expansion)
✅ Provide `context add` and `context query` commands
✅ Works with any BaseContextProvider
🔧 Why: Enables quick manual testing and debugging.

# 20. FileContextProvider (JSON) (Roadmap Phase 3 - Plugin & Provider Expansion)
✅ Persist context entries to local JSON files
✅ Useful for demos and offline experiments

# 21. SQLiteContextProvider (Roadmap Phase 3 - Plugin & Provider Expansion)
✅ Lightweight SQL-backed provider for local storage
✅ Reuse existing filter and query logic

# 22. HTTPContextProvider (REST) (Roadmap Phase 3 - Plugin & Provider Expansion)
✅ POST/GET endpoints for remote ingestion and retrieval
✅ Bridge external services with context engine

# 23. Provider Pub/Sub & Broadcast Enhancements (Roadmap Phase 3 - Plugin & Provider Expansion)
✅ Unified publish/subscribe hooks in BaseContextProvider
✅ Broadcast context updates across providers
🔧 Why: Completes subscription support in Phase 3.
# 24. Goal-Driven Feedback Loop
⏳ Analyze history and current actions to nudge context toward user-defined goals
🔧 Why: Enables proactive course correction toward desired states.

## 📦 Release & Community Infrastructure

Packaging, automated publishing and a public documentation hub will make the project easier to consume and contribute to. The tasks above align with key roadmap phases:

- **Phase 2: Stabilization & Distribution** – lines 13–24 in [Roadmap](../../Roadmap.md#L13-L24) describe finalizing the package layout, publishing to PyPI and adding CI/CD workflows. Tasks **16** and **17** deliver these goals.
- **Phase 5: Community & Growth** – lines 40–46 in [Roadmap](../../Roadmap.md#L40-L46) cover launching a docs site and other community tooling. Task **18** implements this milestone.
