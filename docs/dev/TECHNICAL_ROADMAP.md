# 🥇 Priority 1: Core Debugging Infrastructure

1. Context Inspector API
✅ Basic API: list, fetch, filter by time, source, roles
✅ Raw + filtered (Kalman-ready) context view
✅ Support Redis first (extendable to others)
🔧 Why: Base for UI, CLI tools, test harnesses, confidence checking.
🥈 Priority 2: Vector/Embedding Analysis

# 2. Vector Comparison API + Diff Tools
✅ Pairwise comparison (cosine, distance, trust-aware)
✅ VectorCalculator & Filter fused API
✅ Dump vectors to file or visualize drift
🔧 Why: Helps track semantic matching, AI misfires, similarity thresholds.
# 3. Kalman Filter Integration
✅ Add Kalman filter as optional layer in vector calculator
✅ Flag in provider whether to use it
✅ Dump raw vs filtered output for debug
🔧 Why: Adds signal smoothing, suppresses noise in evolving context streams.
🥉 Priority 3: Trust + Flow Debugging

# 4. Trust Calculation Trace
✅ Output intermediate trust values
✅ Identify influence of actor history, vector similarity, and metadata
✅ Enable override for testing
🔧 Why: Trust drift or anomalies are hard to diagnose without this.
# 5. Context Trigger Flow Tracing
✅ Record “context → matched rule → trigger fired”
✅ Capture matching similarity score
✅ (Later) Tie to Robo Connector flow matching engine
🔧 Why: Explains why something happened — a major ask in audits or validation.
🔬 Priority 4: Provider Abstractions & Expansion

# 6. Standardized Context Provider Interface
✅ Formal interface (BaseContextProvider)
✅ Existing RedisContextProvider refactored to implement it
✅ Hooks for filtering and post-processing
🔧 Why: Enables plug-in logic for Redis/Kafka/Static/Memory/etc.
# 7. Cache/MemoryContextProvider (In-Memory Only)
✅ No Redis/Kafka dependency
✅ Use for dev, testing, and minimal setups
✅ Support filtering and similarity search
🔧 Why: Reduces friction for newcomers and local testing.
# 8. KafkaContextProvider (Basic Ingest Only)
✅ Read from Kafka topic, deserialize, store internally or forward to context engine
⏳ No pub/sub or feedback loop yet
🔧 Why: Prepares ground for high-velocity, scalable deployments.
🚧 Priority 5: Preparation for Extensibility & Learning

# 9. Model Interface for Inference & Feedback
✅ Abstract NN behind interface (e.g. ContextEncoderInterface)
✅ Swap in local model, OpenAI, or any provider
✅ (Later) Feedback hook: “was this match correct?”
🔧 Why: Critical to enable learning, personalization, or modular deployments.
# 10. Robo Connector Context Parser
✅ Reads and converts Robo Connector format to your internal format
✅ Optional export
⛔️ Public release TBD
🔧 Why: Allows seamless bridge between ecosystem tools and native context logic.
# 🔌 11. Context Relay / ContextBus (Internal Mesh)
✅ Accept context from multiple sources (Redis, Kafka, Memory, etc.)
✅ Relay/mirror context to other nodes (via HTTP, gRPC, or message broker)
✅ Optional: context filtering before relaying
📎 Use cases: multi-node AI, real-time cooperation, mesh architecture
🔧 Why: Enables distributed agents or Robo Assistants to share situational data in real-time.
📌 Suggestion: Add to Priority 3 or 4, as it's foundational for scaling and very reusable.

# 🧠 12. Network-Aware Context Hooks
✅ Define external hooks/triggers based on context change
✅ Push matched context (or diff) to other services
✅ Allow action broadcasting / event chaining
🔧 Why: Turns your system into a live graph of interconnected services — critical for Robo Assistant, swarm logic, and long-term Neuraflow.
📌 Suggestion: Add to Priority 5, after filter + trigger tracing.
