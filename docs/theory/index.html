  <h1>Contextual AI - Overview</h1>
  <section>
    <h2>General Idea</h2>
    <p>
      Contextual AI is a framework for enhancing artificial intelligence by embedding deep contextual awareness into processing pipelines. Rather than relying on flat input data, it evaluates environmental conditions, time frames, user roles, and network interactions to align memory, responses, and decisions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Context is modeled as a multi-dimensional "cloud" where proximity to the core indicates relevance. It combines symbolic, statistical, and probabilistic reasoning into a single system.

    <h2>Potential Use Cases</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Debugging & Server Monitoring:</strong> Analyze system context to pinpoint failure root causes faster.</li>
      <li><strong>Marketing:</strong> Adjust tone, timing, and offer selection based on user context and mood.</li>
      <li><strong>Multi-agent Decision Making:</strong> Coordinate tasks between AIs with awareness of each agent's role and environment.</li>
      <li><strong>Personalized Automation:</strong> Use context and trust layers to adapt workflows to individual users or machines.</li>
      <li><strong>Data Privacy Engines:</strong> Determine access rights based on context granularity and trust scores.</li>
    </ul>
