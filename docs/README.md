# Documentation

This project ships developer guides and design notes as static HTML files.

- Open `dev/index.html` for developer-focused documentation.
- Open `theory/index.html` for theoretical background and architecture notes.

In the future these pages may move to a dedicated docs site (see
[docs/dev/TECHNICAL_ROADMAP.md](dev/TECHNICAL_ROADMAP.md)).
