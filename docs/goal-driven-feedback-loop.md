# Goal-Driven Feedback Loop

This document outlines the first steps in implementing a goal-driven feedback loop.

## 1. Clarify the Objective
- Define goals using the SMART framework:
  - **Specific** – clearly state the outcome (e.g., "increase monthly revenue").
  - **Measurable** – identify metrics such as conversion rate, units sold, and average order value.
  - **Attainable** – confirm targets are realistic given historical performance and resources.
  - **Relevant** – ensure the goal aligns with broader organizational strategy.
  - **Time-bound** – specify a timeframe or allow user-configurable limits.

## 2. Plan and Execute
- Break the goal into concrete actions or experiments.
- Prioritize tasks by expected impact and effort.
- Track execution with an event logger to correlate actions with outcomes.

## Roadmap Overview
1. Clarify the objective.
2. Plan and execute actions.
3. Gather feedback.
4. Analyze and reflect.
5. Adjust and iterate.
6. Document and share.

Additional details for steps 3–6 will be expanded in future documentation.
