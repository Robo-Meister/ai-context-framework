# Goal-Driven Feedback Loop

This document outlines the first steps in implementing a goal-driven feedback loop.

## 1. Clarify the Objective
- Define goals using the SMART framework:
  - **Specific** – clearly state the outcome (e.g., "increase monthly revenue").
  - **Measurable** – identify metrics such as conversion rate, units sold, and average order value.
  - **Attainable** – confirm targets are realistic given historical performance and resources.
  - **Relevant** – ensure the goal aligns with broader organizational strategy.
  - **Time-bound** – specify a timeframe or allow user-configurable limits.

## 2. Plan and Execute
- Break the goal into concrete actions or experiments.
- Prioritize tasks by expected impact and effort.
- Track execution with an event logger to correlate actions with outcomes.
- Persist the evolving history inside the feedback loop so repeated calls can
  use the latest context without resending the full timeline.

## 3. Gather Feedback
- Collect quantitative data such as key metrics, KPIs, and event logs.
- Capture qualitative input from users, stakeholders, or market trends.
- Store contextual factors (e.g., seasonality or campaigns) alongside results.

## 4. Analyze and Reflect
- Compare collected feedback against the defined objective and metrics.
- Identify patterns, anomalies, and root causes of success or shortfalls.
- Use historical context to distinguish action-driven effects from external trends.
- Surface lightweight analytics (gap, baseline, momentum) alongside suggested
  actions so downstream systems can quickly understand why a recommendation was
  made.

## 5. Adjust and Iterate
- Refine or reprioritize tactics based on analytical insights.
- Decide whether to continue, modify, or retire existing approaches.
- Loop back into planning with updated knowledge and context.

## 6. Document and Share
- Record goals, actions, outcomes, and lessons learned.
- Communicate insights to relevant teams and stakeholders.
- Maintain an archive to inform future goal-setting and execution.
