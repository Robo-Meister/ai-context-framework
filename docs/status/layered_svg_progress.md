# Layered SVG Generation Progress

This document summarises the current capabilities and remaining follow-up items for the layered SVG generation workflow driven by text prompts.

## Implemented

- **Reference pipeline** – `SvgLayerPipeline` orchestrates context collection, inference requests, and post-processing. It normalises incoming metadata into prompt-friendly packets, merges audit logging, and validates model output before returning a manifest for downstream tooling.【F:src/caiengine/pipelines/svg_layer_pipeline.py†L14-L205】【F:src/caiengine/pipelines/svg_layer_pipeline.py†L206-L318】
- **Validation safeguards** – The pipeline verifies that each generated layer references a known asset fragment, attaches canonical fragment IDs, and enriches the response with bounding boxes and asset paths when available. Invalid references surface as warnings instead of hard failures.【F:src/caiengine/pipelines/svg_layer_pipeline.py†L206-L318】
- **Action planning helper** – `SvgActionPlanner` converts validated plans into explicit add/transform/remove commands, including layer metadata, bounding boxes, and inline SVG payloads so downstream services can perform precise edits.【F:src/caiengine/pipelines/svg_layer_actions.py†L1-L247】【F:tests/test_svg_layer_actions.py†L1-L123】
- **Unit coverage** – `tests/test_svg_layer_pipeline.py` exercises asset normalisation, JSON-plan parsing, validation behaviour, and warning emission so regressions are caught in CI.【F:tests/test_svg_layer_pipeline.py†L1-L102】
- **Usage guidance** – `docs/svg_layered_generation.md` outlines asset library conventions, prompting patterns, and pipeline integration tips for layered outputs.【F:docs/svg_layered_generation.md†L1-L118】

## Next steps

- Expand automated tests to cover constraint handling, canvas overrides, and audit logging branches.
- Provide runnable examples that feed real SVG metadata through the pipeline and compose the resulting plan with an SVG manipulation library.
- Explore lightweight schema validation for context entries to catch malformed metadata before inference time.
